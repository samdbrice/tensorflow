    "# Introduction to TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "As artificial intelligence has advanced, applications have needed to process larger and larger amounts of data.  A prime example of this is the field of neural networks.  These machine learning models are enormously flexible and powerful, but they require huge amounts of both time and data to train.  Building tools to accomplish this can be difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google had been using neural networks internally for some time when they decided to develop a single framework flexible enough to be used for many different purposes.  That project became TensorFlow, and it was released as an open-source project in November, 2015.  Version 1.0 was released just over a year later, in February, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "This generality has made TensorFlow useful for a number of different applications.  At its heart, it is a general-purpose computation engine, optimized for large data.  With TensorFlow, you define your program in terms of a computation graph.  Then, the graph is executed by letting data, in the form of tensors, flow through it.  (And you thought the name was just chosen to sound good!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will introduce you to both the basics of TensorFlow and the basics of neural networks.  By focusing on the basics, we hope to convey a solid understanding of the theory and practice behind neural networks in TensorFlow.  For purposes of time, many of our example will be small and short, and therefore will not produce spectacular results.  Nonetheless, this should be enough to get you started on your own spectacular projects!\n",

    "In TensorFlow, computations are conceptualized as graphs.  These graphs are **directed** (the edges have a direction) and **acyclic** (there are no loops).  The nodes of the are **operations**, which may have zero or more inputs and zero or more outputs.  Hooking the output of one operation into the input of the next produces the computation graph.\n",

This avoids the namespace pollution that comes with an `import *`, but saves a lot of keystrokes over time.  We'll also import numpy, a Python library for numerical computation, as `np`, for future use."
